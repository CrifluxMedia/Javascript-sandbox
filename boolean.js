//Examples of errors in java script
//syntax errors-the red line shows when you write an error language
//reference error-it is like trying to call something that does not exist--you can only use a variable after initializing
//have the skill to Debug your code
//when you want to Debug first check your console-the console gives feedback on the lines that are affected
//primitive data types can only hold one value
//BOOLEAN VALUE have only two things which is true or false -they are used to make decisions
//WHAT to know when working with boolean values-comparison operators  > < == === <= >=   when there is two equality sign it is called a loose equality sign(doesn't check data types)while 3 is called a strict equality sign
//LOGICAL OPERATORS and &&, or ||, !not
//working with and the all conditions must be fulfilled
//everything must be true for the whole thing to be true
//when working with an and operator the moment there is false then everything becomes false
//for the or you must have a true for everything to be true
//not is just use to negate(deny the existence)
//TRUTHY AND FALSY VALUES-there are values evaluated as true and values evaluated as false
//in strings all values are truthy values
//truthy vlues are substansial things ,something you can work with--all valid numbers wether negative or positive are truthy values--the only numbers that will give false value is (0)
//null and undefined are falsy value
